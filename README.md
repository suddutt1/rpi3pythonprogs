# My Raspberi Pi 3 experiment with Python



1. **3_color_blink.py** : Blinks 3 LEDs continuously in sequence
2. **blink.py** : Hello world of RPi world
3. **pirsensor.py** : Tried to get the PIR sensor work, but always getting 1. Not able to adjust the sensor sensitivity due to lack of documentation
4. **ultrasound.py** : Basic distance measurment with HC-SR04 . Circuit diagram from [https://electrosome.com/hc-sr04-ultrasonic-sensor-raspberry-pi/]
5. **dist_becon.py** : Based on the distance,  change the color of the falshing LEDs . 3 LEDs are attached
